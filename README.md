# AV1-SLICE

Here, we provide comprehensive information and resources related to our project that aims to optimize Quality of Service (QoS) in video streaming networks. This project includes the development and evaluation of the AV1-SLICE video codec, which uses slicing techniques to enhance the performance of AV1 video codecs in networked environments.

In this repository, you will find all the necessary information, code, and data to understand, reproduce, and build upon our work. Our project includes the implementation of the Mininet network emulator, Nginx web server, Iperf network performance measurement tool, and Wireshark network packet analyzer to perform experiments and evaluate the performance of AV1-SLICE. The experiments simulate different video quality levels and measure key network QoS metrics such as throughput, jitter, and loss rate for the different layers of the transmitted streams.

We will add a detailed description of our experimental setup and configuration, along with the results and analysis of our experiments. You will find information on the system requirements and dependencies needed to run our experiments and the necessary steps to reproduce our results.

We hope this repository will serve as a useful resource for researchers, students, and practitioners in the fields of networked video streaming, video codecs, and QoS optimization. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out to us via skeshvadi@tru.ca .
